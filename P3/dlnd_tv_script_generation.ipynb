    "## 问题\n",
    "1. lstm的zero_state与batch_size有什么关系，是因为lstm中用于长时记忆的单元状态的size与batch_size有关么？\n",
    "2. embedding的时候为什么大部分资料都使用random_normal，而不用tf.truncated_normal,stddev=0.1来初始化权重？\n",
    "3. 为什么单层RNN网络效果比多层的RNN网络效果好，什么情况下适合使用多层的RNN网络？\n",
    "4. 疑惑很久的问题，就该项目描述下我对于RNN网络的理解，假设一个RNN网络的物理结构有1个embedding层、3个LSTM层（n个cell）和最后的1个全连接层，每次的输入是一个单词，用于预测下一个单词，就是说只有在当前单词输入之后才能输入下一个单词，否则网络等于没有学习当前单词及其序列关系，在对RNN网络按时间展开后，每次可以输入一个seq_length长度个单词，输出另外一个seq_length长度的单词，在展开后的网络中，实际应该有并行的seq_length个RNN网络，也就有seq_length个全连接层（每次时间点一个），那么为什么在项目中dynamic_rnn之后只建立了一个全连接层，不是seq_length个全连接层，而输入全连接层的数据是包含批次和序列信息的dynamic_rnn的所有输出，这里太容易让人混淆了。另外， 输入到全连接层的数据是每个时间点输入一次的还是每个sequence一起进行一次输入，就是说在RNN输出后，所输入的数据是一起输入给全连接层还是按照时间顺序依次输入给全连接层？如果是按时间序列依次输入给全连接层，为什么在Anna KaRNNa项目中，要对RNN的输出进行concat和reshape后利用tf.matmul计算logits，这里在reshape之后，张量不就变成2维的了么，最后不就只能有一个字母的预测了么，这样不是丢失了序列信息了么?"
